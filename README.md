# SetupCheckerBot

Reddit bot that is currently live at [/u/SetupCheckerBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/SetupCheckerBot) on [/r/iOSthemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes).

It makes sure that users submitting device setups post top level comments that include things used to create their setups.

The bot is hosted on Heroku with the intention that running the bot is free of cost to me, so major decisions in how it was written is meant to accomodate that.

**Things that can be improved**

* Use OAuth instead of username + password to log in
* Move all strings to a config file
* Write the bot so it runs continuously (doing this costs money of course)
